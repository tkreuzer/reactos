VADs
----
There are 2 types of VADs: user mode VADs and kernel mode VADs
user mode VADs are allocated from the process' VAD pool, which is an area
in hyperspace next to the ws lists. kernel mode VADs are allocated from NP
pool.


Page fault handling
--------------------
- Nested fault handling of paged out page tables, that is a fault on a virtual
  address, where the page table was paged out, will cause the page fault handler
  to access the PTE and cause a nested page fault, that will first bring in the
  page table and then ...



- File backed: The PTE contains a link to the subsection that backs up the page
- page file backed: PTE contains the page file index
- copy on write: bit is set



Large Pages
