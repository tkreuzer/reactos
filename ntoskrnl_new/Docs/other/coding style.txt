- Don't try to be funny. Good programmers are seldom funny. Don't try to prove
  that this doesn't apply to you, by writing comments that are supposed to be
  funny or in any other way "creative".

- Comment your code in an appropriate way / extent. There is no need to comment
  on every line of code, but every chunk of code that does one thing should have
  a comment, what it does. Do not comment the obvious (/* increment i */). The
  less obvious something is, the more it needs to be commented. Try to summerize
  what a certain piece of code does rather than rephrasing the code.

- Comment your code before you commit it, preferably while writing it. Committing
  now, commenting later won't work.

- Comment style is C-Style (/* ... */)

- General formatting style is Allman/Ansi style with the following exceptions:
  - if statements may be on one line
  - ...

- Indentation is 4 spaces.

- Please always keep code readable. If a function becomes too large, split it.

- The human brain is capable of processing about 7 informations at a time.
  Keep that in mind when writing highly nested code constructs. Flat code
  is always prefered for readability. Do not hesitate to use a goto, when
  it can make code easier to read and understand.
