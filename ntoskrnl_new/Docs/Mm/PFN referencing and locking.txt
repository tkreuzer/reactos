1.) Use RefCount only. Mapping is 1 Ref, Locking 2. Unmapping and unlocking
    is deref. When it's derefed to 0, check if a flag (Committed) is set,
    which specifies, that the contents are still in use and the page has only
    been swapped out. In that case (and when the page is dirty) move the page
    to the standby list, otherwise (when the page was decommitted) the page is
    not in use anymore and can be put on the free list.
    The outswapper checks whether a page, that is either mapped privately or
    part of a section and is next on the list of pages to check, has a refCount
    of only 1. In that case, the PTE is converted into a page file PTE and the
    PFN is removed from the working set list and put on the outswap list
    Locking requires 2 RefCounts, so that if the page got
    decommitted, it still has RefCount > 1 and cannot be removed
