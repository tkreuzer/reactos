Sections
--------

- Section objects do not have an Open routine, so the Object manager will
  return a pointer to the original object, when a named section is opened.
- For memory sections: the same section memory <=> the same section object
- There can be multiple file backed sections for the same physical file,
  each of these with different page protection, allocation attributes, ...
- DesiredAccess is only passed to the ObjectManager, it's ignored in
  MmCreateSection()

- A view of a section can only be mapped at an address that is aligned on
  a 64k boundary (allocation granularity)
