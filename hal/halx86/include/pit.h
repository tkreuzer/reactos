/*
 * Commonly stated as being 1.19318MHz
 *
 * See ISA System Architecture 3rd Edition (Tom Shanley, Don Anderson, John Swindle)
 * P. 471
 *
 * However, the true value is closer to 1.19318181[...]81MHz since this is 1/3rd
 * of the NTSC color subcarrier frequency which runs at 3.57954545[...]45MHz.
 *
 * Note that Windows uses 1.193167MHz which seems to have no basis. However, if
 * one takes the NTSC color subcarrier frequency as being 3.579545 (trimming the
 * infinite series) and divides it by three, one obtains 1.19318167.
 *
 * It may be that the original NT HAL source code introduced a typo and turned
 * 119318167 into 1193167 by ommitting the "18". This is very plausible as the
 * number is quite long.
